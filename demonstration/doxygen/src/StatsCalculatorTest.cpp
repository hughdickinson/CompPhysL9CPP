/** The main function is the entry point for the program. The program is designed
 * to be invoked with two command line arguments and will output an error message
 * if the incorrect number of command line arguments is not supplied.
 *
 * \param argc - The number of command line tokens including the executable name 
 * and command line arguments.
 *
 * \param argv - The \b first command line argument, available as argv[1] is expected to be the
 * path of an input file containing a white-space separated list of numeric values.
 * The \b second command line argument, available as argv[2] is expected to be the
 * path to which a file containing a statistical summary of the numeric values
 * provided by the input file.
 *
 * The program instantiates a StatsCalculator object and invokes its public methods
 * in order to:
 *
 * -# Open the input file, parse its contents and store the numeric values in an
 * internal std::vector<double>.
 * -# Print a statistical summary comprising the sum, mean and standard deviation
 * of the numeric values to the terminal.
 * -# Individually access each statistic and print their values to the terminal with
 * annotation.
 * -# Write a statistical summary comprising the sum, mean and standard deviation
 * of the numeric values to the user-specified output file.
 *
 * \return The program returns zero on success and 1 if an incorrect number of command line
 * arguments was provided.
