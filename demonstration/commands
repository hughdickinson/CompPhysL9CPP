# LECTURE 9: AUTOMATIC CODE DOCUMENTATION USING DOXYGEN
# =====================================================
#
# The doxygen utility enables automatic documentation generation
# using information extracted from specially formatted comments
# within your source code.
#
# To enable basic doxygen support the required modifications to
# existing code comments are minimal.
#
# Multiline comment blocks can be exposed for extraction by the
# doxygen utility by adding an extra "*" character to the opening
# "/*" diglyph, forming the triglyph "/**".
#
# Single line comments can be exposed for extraction by the
# doxygen utility by adding an extra "/" character to the opening
# "//" diglyph, forming the triglyph "///".
#
# The doxygen utility is also able to interpret several special
# tokens within your comments that enable more advanced formatting
# of the documentation it generates.
#
# Specific entities within the source code can be explicitly
# identified. For example the "\class" token at the beginning of a
# comment specifies that the subsequent token defines the name of
# the class and the remainder of the comment provides an overall
# class description.
#
# Another particularly useful token is "\brief" which can be used
# to provide an abbreviated description for programatic entities.
#
# The "\param" token is used to specify that subsequent text
# describes the requirements or interpretation of a function or
# method parameter.
#
# Other tokens can be used to control the textual formatting of the
# documentation. For example, the "\b" token specifies that the
# subsequent word should be emboldened.
#
# Documentation can LaTeX formatted equations, which are identified
# within comments by enclosing them between "\f" tokens.
#
# A useful reference, listing the most commonly used comment tokens
# that are understood by doxygen can be obtained from:

# INSTALLING DOXYGEN:
# ===================
#
# If you have not already done so, add the doxygen utility to your
# VirtualBox Ubuntu Linux installation using:

sudo apt-get install doxygen

# GENERATING A TEMPLATE CONFIGURATION FILE:
# =========================================
#
# Operation of the doxygen utility is customized using a configuration
# file. To generate a template configuration file called "doxygen.config",
# invoke:

doxygen -g doxygen.config

# Inspect the contents of the template configuration file.

emacs doxygen.config &

# The file is very long and enables numerous features to be enabled
# and customized. This demonstration focusses on the generation of
# HTML documentation but information about the remaining options is
# available from:
# http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/
#


# MODIFYING THE SOURCE CODE COMMENTS:
# ===================================
#
# To demonstrate the formatting that is required by doxygen, a model
# implementation of the StatsCalculator class from Question 18 of the
# Lecture 6 Homework will be used.
#
# Inspect the contents of the "include/StatsCalculator.h" file

emacs include/StatsCalculator.h &

# The file has already been modified in several places to adopt the
# doxygen syntax. To see the
