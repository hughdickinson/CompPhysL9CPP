# LECTURE 9: AUTOMATIC CODE DOCUMENTATION USING DOXYGEN
# =====================================================
#
# The doxygen utility enables AUTOMATIC DOCUMENTATION GENERATION
# using information extracted from SPECIALLY FORMATTED COMMENTS
# within your source code.
#
# To enable BASIC doxygen support the required MODIFICATIONS to
# existing code comments are MINIMAL.
#
# MULTILINE comment blocks can be exposed for extraction by the
# doxygen utility by adding an extra "*" character to the opening
# "/*" diglyph, forming the triglyph "/**".
#
# SINGLE LINE comments can be exposed for extraction by the
# doxygen utility by adding an extra "/" character to the opening
# "//" diglyph, forming the triglyph "///".
#
# The doxygen utility is also able to interpret several SPECIAL
# TOKENS within your comments that enable more ADVANCED FORMATTING
# of the documentation it generates.
#
# SPECIFIC ENTITIES within the source code can be EXPLICITLY
# IDENTIFIED. For example the "\class" token at the beginning of a
# comment specifies that the subsequent token defines the name of
# the class and the remainder of the comment provides an overall
# class description.
#
# The "\file" token is used to trigger documentation of files that
# do not contain class or class method definitions. For example,
# a file that only contains a main() function would not be documented
# unless a comment containing the "\file" token is added.
#
# Another particularly useful token is "\brief" which can be used
# to provide an abbreviated description for programatic entities.
#
# The "\param" token is used to specify that subsequent text
# describes the requirements or interpretation of a function or
# method parameter.
#
# The "\return" token is used to specify that subsequent text
# describes the value that is returned by a function or method under
# various possible exit conditions.
#
# The "\note" token is used to specify that subsequent text
# is particularly important and should be highligted in documentation.
#
# The tokens that have been introduced so far affect all subsequent text
# until TWO SUCCESSIVE NEWLINES are encountered.
#
# Other tokens can be used to control the textual formatting of the
# documentation. For example, the "\b" token specifies that the
# subsequent word should be emboldened.
#
# Documentation can LaTeX formatted equations, which are identified
# within comments by enclosing them between "\f" tokens.
#
# A useful reference, listing the most commonly used comment tokens
# that are understood by doxygen can be obtained from:
# http://www.digilife.be/quickreferences/QRC/Doxygen%20Quick%20Reference.pdf
#
# To demonstrate the formatting that is required by doxygen, a model
# implementation of the StatsCalculator class from Question 18 of the
# Lecture 6 Homework will be used.

# OPTIONAL: INSTALLING TEXLIVE:
# ===================
#
# The doxygen utility allows MATHEMATICAL FORMULAE to be specified
# using format expected by the LaTeX typesetting utility. To utilize
# this functionality, a LaTeX package must be installed. If you do not
# install LaTeX, doxygen will "gracefully" fall back and render the
# raw LaTeX syntax in your documentation:
#
# The installation MAY TAKE SEVERAL HOURS and is NOT ESSENTIAL.

sudo apt-get install texlive

# INSTALLING DOXYGEN:
# ===================
#
# If you have not already done so, add the doxygen utility to your
# VirtualBox Ubuntu Linux installation using:

sudo apt-get install doxygen

# GENERATING A TEMPLATE CONFIGURATION FILE:
# =========================================
#
# OPERATION of the doxygen utility is CUSTOMIZED using a CONFIGURATION
# FILE. To generate a TEMPLATE configuration file called "doxygen.config",
# invoke:

doxygen -g doxygen.config

# Inspect the contents of the template configuration file.

emacs doxygen.config &

# The file is very long and enables NUMEROUS FEATURES TO BE ENABLED
# AND CUSTOMIZED. The file includes detailed documentation is for all
# available options. HTML documentation about the available options is
# also available from:
# http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/
#
# This demonstration focusses on the generation of HTML documentation
# and only the following settings need to be modified from their default
# values:
#
# PROJECT_NAME, OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, REPEAT_BRIEF, BUILTIN_STL_SUPPORT,
# EXTRACT_PRIVATE, INPUT, FILE_PATTERNS, SOURCE_BROWSER, GENERATE_LATEX
#
# The "doxygen" subdirectory of the directory containing this file contains
# APPROPRIATELY MODIFIED CONFIGURATION FILE called "demoDoxygen.config"
# You can compare the default (generated) configuration file with the modified
# if neccessary.

# MODIFYING THE SOURCE CODE COMMENTS:
# ===================================
#
# The files comprising the implementation of the StatsCalculator
# have ALREADY BEEN MODIFIED in several places to adopt the
# doxygen syntax, and an INITIAL set of HTML documentation has been
# generated. To view this initial documentation invoke

firefox docs/html/index.html # (Exit from window or use Ctrl+C)

# SOME METHODS HAVE NOT BEEN DOCUMENTED AND THE CLASS DOES NOT HAVE AN
# OVERALL DESCRIPTION. Moreover the "StatsCalculatorTest.cpp" file is NOT
# DOCUMENTED. To rectify this, several MODIFICATIONS TO THE COMMENTS within
# "include/StatsCalculator.h", "src/StatsCalculator.cpp", and
# "src/StatsCalculatorTest.cpp" are required. Appropriate modification points
# have been indicated using the easily identifiable token pair "@@ DOXYGEN".
# A set of FULLY MODIFIED source code files is stored in the "src" and 
# "include" subdirectories of the "doxygen" subdirectory of the directory
# containing this file.
#
# Inspect and modify the contents of the "include/StatsCalculator.h",
# "src/StatsCalculator.cpp" and "src/StatsCalculatorTest.cpp" files.
#

emacs include/StatsCalculator.h &
emacs src/StatsCalculator.cpp &
emacs src/StatsCalculatorTest.cpp &

# One modification will entail insertion of the following LaTeX-formatted
# equation.
#
# \sigma = \sqrt{\langle X^{2} \rangle - \langle X \rangle^{2}}
#
# Now INVOKE THE DOXYGEN UTILITY to generate some updated HTML documentation.

doxygen demoDoxygen.config

# To view this NEW documentation invoke

firefox docs/html/index.html
